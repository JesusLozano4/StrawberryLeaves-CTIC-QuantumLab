# Quantum classification of strawberry leaves
This project originates from previous work on the **ARQA Demonstrator 1**, within the framework of **[Cervera Network ARQA](https://redarqa.es/)**. The architectures and structures developed in that phase have been adapted and repurposed to create a disease detection system for strawberry leaves. This initiative aims to increase the visibility of **Quantum Computing** within the agricultural sector, showcasing its practical utility and its promise for future scalability.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Setup and Data (Releases)
The dataset and trained models are hosted in the **Releases** section of this repository. Please download the files and organize the `dataset` directory as follows:

- dataset/
  - 2hojas_HybridCNN.pth
  - 2hojas_QCNN.pth
  - best.pt

## Usage Workflow
The correct workflow for using this project is as follows:

1. **Preprocessing:** First, create the leaf crops by running the `CropLeaves.ipynb` notebook.
2. **Model Testing:** Depending on whether you want to test the Hybrid or Quantum model, use `HQNN.ipynb` or `QCNN.ipynb` respectively.
3. **Training & Hyperparameters:** If you wish to modify the training hyperparameters for the classification models, use `TrainHQNN.ipynb` or `TrainQCNN.ipynb`.
